Hey, I'm a beginer to using github other than roblox exploiting so this is my first repo, actually not true my first one is bugged. But anyway this is CaledonianAI, it is not an actual LLM just a pretty simple chatbot like really early ones,
I ported this from scratch as thats where i'm used to coding
It is not built for Mobile and made specicaly for Computer it may be buggy sometimes and be patiant, thats all i have for this.
